## Stash Organizer [WIP]
Data visualization of yarn stash. Sortable and filterable.
Currently collects data from Ravelry and parses and prints out basic stash information. I have added an example config file if you would like to try it out on your on your own machine! You can request api tokens at https://www.ravelry.com/pro/developer

## Scrap Tagger [WIP]
Auto tags stash yarn as scraps if the leftovers from a project are deemed as scrap. Adds scrap yarn automatically to a selected scrap project in the queue.

## Project Data Visualization [WIP]
Some charts containing fun information about project data visualization

## Pattern Stitch and Hour Estimator [WIP]
Estimates the number of stitches in an unmodded project given the size made. Uses this to estimate the number of hours it would take to complete the project given a knitter's stitches per minute.
